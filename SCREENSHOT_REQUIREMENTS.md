## Including Screenshots in PDF

### Best Practices:
1. Insert screenshots after written answers
2. Add captions below each screenshot:
   - "Figure 1: Relationship Diagram"
   - "Figure 2: Query Result"
   - "Figure 3: Tabular Form"
   - "Figure 4: Report"
3. Ensure screenshots are properly sized
   - Not too small (unreadable)
   - Not too large (takes up whole page)
4. Check readability
   - Text must be clear
   - No blurriness
   - Proper contrast

### PDF Structure:
```

Question 2.2 (Written - No Screenshot)
