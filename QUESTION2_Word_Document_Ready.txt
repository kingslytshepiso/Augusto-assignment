QUESTION 2.2: DESCRIBE THE FIRST SIX DATA TYPES USED IN MS ACCESS AND 
THEIR FUNCTIONS (6 marks)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SHORT TEXT (TEXT DATA TYPE)

Function:
Short Text is used to store alphanumeric characters and can accommodate up to 
255 characters. It is designed for storing text-based information that does 
not require mathematical operations or extensive formatting.

Common Uses:
- Names (first names, last names)
- Addresses
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Product descriptions
- Category labels

Example: "John Smith", "123 Main Street", "john@email.com"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. LONG TEXT (MEMO DATA TYPE)

Function:
Long Text can store significantly larger amounts of text data, up to 65,535 
characters. It is ideal for storing detailed descriptions, notes, or paragraphs 
of text that exceed the Short Text limit.

Common Uses:
- Detailed product descriptions
- Notes and comments
- Customer feedback
- Medical history notes
- Meeting minutes

Example: Detailed class descriptions, member notes, instructor qualifications

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. NUMBER

Function:
The Number data type stores numeric values that can be used in mathematical 
calculations. It supports various numeric formats including integers, decimals, 
and can be configured for different precision levels.

Common Uses:
- Quantities and counts
- Ages
- Ratings and scores
- Measurement values
- Quantities in inventory

Example: 25 (capacity), 10 (class count), 85 (member ID)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. DATE/TIME

Function:
Date/Time stores both date and time information in a standardized format. 
Access automatically formats these values and allows for date/time calculations 
and sorting.

Common Uses:
- Birth dates
- Appointment times
- Transaction dates
- Registration dates
- Schedule times
- Due dates

Example: 15/03/2025, 09:00:00 AM

four decimal places and automatically formats them as currency, ensuring 
precision in financial calculations.

Common Uses:
- Prices and fees
- Salaries
- Membership costs
- Transaction amounts
- Budget allocations

Example: R500.00, R1,250.75

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. AUTONUMBER

Function:
AutoNumber automatically generates a unique sequential number for each new 
record. It cannot be manually edited and ensures each record has a unique 
identifier, making it ideal for primary keys.

Common Uses:
- Primary key fields
- Unique record identifiers
- Sequential numbering systems
- Order numbers

Example: 1, 2, 3, 4... (automatically assigned)
